            <h1>Zinc Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or
                make a purchase from
                <a href="https://zinc.work/">https://zinc.work</a> (the “Site”).</p>
            <h2>Personal information we collect</h2>
            <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information
                about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
                Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view,
                what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site.
                We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>
            <p>We collect device Information using the following technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
                    identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
                    <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
                <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
                    Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
                <li>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse
                    the Site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information
                from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card
                numbers or cryptographic payment addresses), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information
                as “Order Information.”</p>
            <p>We collect work-related information, work history data, work performance, progression and competency data. Storage
                of this data is facilitated by Zinc but not owned by Zinc. We will only have access to this data if you request
